# ShopTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

To run the e2e tests we need to download the latest binary of Cypress from their website as the version of node used in this project is not supported by the latest version of cypress.

https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Direct-download

And then execute the binary and follow on-screen instructions.
